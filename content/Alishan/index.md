The project is a new build 80 key room hotel in Taiwan’s mountainous Alishan region, under Intercontinental Hotel Group (IHG)’s Indigo branding which centres on the concept of the “Neighbourhood Story.” In this context, we chose to showcase the lessser-known culture of the indigenous Tsou tribe to form a narrative distinctly unique and paying homage to Alishan’s richness.
